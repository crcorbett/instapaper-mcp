# Frontend composition

Routes and feature boundaries own data loading, Effect/service execution,
mutations, commands, shared state, workflow/error policy, and SSR restoration.
Presentation leaves receive narrow readonly values and action callbacks, then
own rendering, accessibility, pure derivation, and genuinely local UI state.
Prefer children/slots and colocated feature components. Reject service-aware
leaves, boolean-prop matrices, synchronization Effects, hooks that rename one
call, and giant route components.
